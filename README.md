# Autorriculum

A tool based on python to automate the generation of curriculums using a template filled with data. The template has to use [jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/templates/) syntax.

The template used must be a Microsoft Word Document file and the information to print on the template must follow the JSON standard.

If the template and the information are both valid, the script will output as much information as it can from the information file on the template and save it to the specified file.
